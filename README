Okay, so this little folder is demonstrating how to use the 
`clusterProfiler` library to do GO term and GSEA term enrichment for 
lists of yeast genes, using R.
It's a way to do this programaticaly so you can get it into your 
local laptop scripting workflow, instead of having to click on things
in a web browser. Reproducibility by scripting it.

There's two analyses you can do. One is set enrichment, one is rank
enrichment. The first requires that you have a list of gene 
identifiers that are your set of some kind, and then you have a list
of the background gene identifiers you're comparing these two.
The second requires that you have all gene identifiers, and you
order these by some value. Then the algorithm looks for enrichment of
particular terms towards the ends of the list. 

You can also use multiple sources for gene terms. One is to use
the Bioconductor organism database definition (easiest), but you
might also want to control terms by using the GO slim list from SGD
or some other list more focused towards your biological question.
Your call.
