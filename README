This repo tracks subtrees of a couple of example analyses or code 
snippets that might be useful.

- barseq :
    - 
- rmd_to_pdf :
    - This is an example of setting up a rmarkdown-`render`'d 
      document so that it makes a nice PDF. It's intended for
      supplementary materials.

      Change into the directory and enter `make all` to demonstrate.

- term-enrichment :
    - This an example of using the `clusterProfiler` package to
      look at GO term enrichment and GSEA. There's nothing about
      plotting, just the output.

      Change into the directory and enter `make all` to demonstrate.
      You will need to unzip the file [here](https://osf.io/fb3m6/).
      It may segfault, just re-run the command to finish it.
