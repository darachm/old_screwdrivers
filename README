This repo tracks subtrees of a couple of example analyses or code 
snippets that might be useful.

- barseq :

    - 

- rmd_to_pdf :

    - This is an example of setting up a rmarkdown-`render`'d 
      document so that it makes a nice PDF. It's intended for
      supplementary materials.

      Change into the directory and enter `make all` to demonstrate.

- term-enrichment :

    - This an example of using the `clusterProfiler` package to
      look at term enrichment and GSEA. It uses simulations on
      a toy example to explore the concept (a bit), then does so
      using GO terms and complexes from SGD. A minimal introduction,
      useful for being able to do GSEA using these tools on arbitrary
      labels/terms.
